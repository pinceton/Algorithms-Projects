The Cache Schemes program takes in a string of characters and the cache size from the user, and then it sorts the strings using the Least Recently Used, Least Frequently Used, Furthest In Future, and First In First Out algorithms. Then a window is displayed that shows how many collisions occurred for each algorithm while sorting the string.

The Recursive Art project displays 3 different shapes using recursion based off of a sample picture supplied. These shapes are in the top left, top right, and bottom left of the screen. In the bottom right window, we were instructed to create our own artistic design using recursion. ***SEIZURE WARNING*** I used a random number generator to change the color of my shapes. Since the shapes are constantly drawn while the program runs, this creates a bright rainbow-strobe-light affect.
